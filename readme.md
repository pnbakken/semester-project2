# In Bloom - Semester Project 2

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dt8j2ptfq/image/upload/v1655303981/portfolio/projects/in-bloom_zrgdbu.png)

Florist e-commerce front-end. [Live site](https://flowersinbloom.netlify.app/s)

## Description

The aim of this project was to demonstrate that I could set up a simple API, fetch from it, and let an authenticated admin make edits and add new entries. Unfortunately the API was hosted on Heroku and therefore no longer exists. Which is a shame as I spent some time getting all the product photography done and I was quite pleased with this project in general. Once I have more time to fiddle around with old projects I'll recreate the API so I can use this for demonstration purposes again.

Features of the site when all the parts are running are:

- Product display
- Featured product display
- Add and remove products from cart
- Admin login
- Product management section (add product, delete, edit, set featured)
